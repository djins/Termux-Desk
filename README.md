Welcome,
To The World Of Termux-Desk or TermDesk.
Looks Great Nah ?
Huh... ?

# Why This ?
I Have Seen Many Github Repos,
That Can Install X11 Desktop with Usabli In Termux...
Containing a Huge Load'a Code

Note- 'Load'a Code' repo Containing Code & Folders in A Spider Web..

Which Is Possibly Impossible to Understand Especially For One Who Is New To This And Just Trying To Make Out Fun With Termux... And Also For Advanced Users  ...🤷‍♀️

# Installation

So...
Here We Go.
Termux Desk or TermDesk
The Repo Is Easily Understoodable  For 'Noobs' , Every Code Contains Clarity...
