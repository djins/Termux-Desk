Welcome To The World Of Termux-Desk or TermDesk.
Looks Great Nah ?
Its Bit Complicated To Install It.😳
Huh... Just Kidding 😄

I Have Seen Many Github Repos That Can Install X11 Desktop Natively In Termux...
Containing a Huge Load'a Code

Note- 'Load'a Code' repo Containing Code & Folders in A Spider Web..

Which Is Possibly Impossible to Understand Especially For One Who Is New To This And Just Trying To Make Out Fun With Termux... And Also For Advanced Users  ...🤷‍♀️

So...
Here We Go.
Termux Desk or TermDesk
The Repo Is Easily Understoodable  For 'Noobs' , Every Code Contains Clarity...
''' Installing Is Simple
Just Copy The Code Bellow And There You Go...
